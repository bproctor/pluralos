# Plural OS
This is a project that I worked on during the late '90s and abandoned around 2002 or 2003.  The goal was to create a Unix operating system that was designed for parallel processing.  Back then in the 386/486/Pentium days most computers only had a single processor, there was no such thing as muli-core processors and only higher end computers and servers had two or four CPUs on the motherboard.  I wanted to try to build an OS specifically for this.

Of course, I didn't really know what I was doing back then, but it's fun to look back.  I don't recommend trying to use any of this code, it's probably terrible. ;)
