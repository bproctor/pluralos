0.0.21
------------------------------------------------------------------------
        - Added man pages
        - Some work done on sys/unistd.h
        - Updated drivers/pci/pci.ids


0.0.20
------------------------------------------------------------------------
        - Added block-devices.txt, and char-devices.txt to list the
          contents of the /dev directory.
        - Other changes, as well, but it's been a while and I don't
          remember.


0.0.19
------------------------------------------------------------------------
        - Messaging code fixups
        - Thread code fixups


0.0.18
------------------------------------------------------------------------
        - Added code to convert time for ClockGetDate() and ClockGetTime()
        - Minor code cleanups all over
        - Updated README
        - Started ext2 code, added include/ext2.h


0.0.17
------------------------------------------------------------------------
        - Replaced include/string.h with a modified inline version from Linux
        - Added include/elf.h
        - Ok, possibly fixed my last by sending EOI after initializing the
          PIC.

        - Still having problems with the timer IRQ code not working
          correctly.  The machine still hangs sometimes at the same
          'Calibrating delay loop...' spot while waiting for an interrupt.


0.0.16
------------------------------------------------------------------------
        - Started code for SMP support.

        - Fixed up the pci database stuff.  Borrowed the Linux stuff instead
          of my own since it's a better.

        - Fixed the ltr(), set_tss_desc(), and new_tss_desc() functions.
          so that they actually work now.
 
        - The kernel running on real hardware seems to work fine now except
          that it reports a processor running at 676Mhz when Linux says
          my processors are running at 1016Mhz. (dual P3-933@1016).


0.0.15
------------------------------------------------------------------------
        - Fixed up the memory initialization code a bit.  Reordered some
          things and now the stuff in .init is actually marked as free in
          the page map after all initialization is completed.

        - I've been noticing that 'make distclean' doesn't always clean up
          all the files.  Many times there are still .o files lingering and
          a second 'make distclean' takes care of them.  Don't know what the
          problem is...

        - Minor cleanups in documents. Updates to README.

        - Minor code cleanups in lib/*

        - The Makefile now creates a gzip compressed kernel.  GRUB can boot
          kernel images that are compressed with gzip.  Another step added
          to the build process 'make install'.

        - Finally I'm able to test this thing on real hardware, and
          unfortunately there is a problem with the irq code somewhere
          because the machine hangs when at 'Calibrating delay loop...'
          The machine I am testing this on is an SMP with an APIC.  Maybe
          that has something to do with it, but I doubt it.  Under bochs
          the kernel works fine... :(

        - plural-splash.xpm.gz was added and is available for download at
          at 'www.plural-os.org', this file can be used with GRUB
          for a pretty background for GRUB's menu interface.  Note that if
          you are using bochs, it won't work correctly because of the VGA
          graphics change.  Also, it wasn't displaying correctly, probably
          GRUB has limitation on number of colors or something like that.
          The file is there if you'd like to mess with it. I will continue
          to try to get it staight.

        - I really need figure out how to get some multitasking into this
          kernel.


0.0.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------
        - Changed Makefile.def to be able to create .a files as targets.
          lib/lib.a is one of them.  That way there is no need to worry
          about dead code getting included in the OS image file.
          Directories that use .a targets specify the target as ATARGET=
          instead of TARGET=

        - Reformatted this file to 72 columns.

        - Added COPYING.DOC, The GNU Free Documentation License.  Any
          documentation that is written and included with this
          operating sytem kernel package can be released using this
          license if need be, or the GPL can be used for this as well.

        - Replaced the INSTALL file with README. Which will be a much
          more thorough document describing how to get Plural running
          on your system.

        - Started network code

        - Removed the compression code and code for loading high.  The
          system will always load high from now on. It simplifies
          things greatly and loading low only causes problems.  If you
          really don't have enough memory to load the kernel above 1Mb
          then... buy some more RAM.

        - Kernel now is at 0x100000 instead of virtual address
          0xE0100000.   This makes the code much simpler and I didn't
          really see the need of loading the kernel into the high memory
          area.

        - The kernel now works with GRUB.  A floppy image and
          instructions for use will be posted on www.plural-os.org in
          the development section.

        - Put the strings from the PCI device database into .init
          section so they won't take up memory after the .init section
          is freed.  Still needs work to build the actual database
          structure for it though.


0.0.13
------------------------------------------------------------------------
        This release will not run correctly when the kernel image gets too
large.  At least it isn't working correctly under bochs.  The compressed
kernel fails to uncompress properly, and uncompressed kernels give
errors when booting under bochs, this only shows up when the kernel
image starts to get large, ???.

        - Updates to syscall code
        - Code cleanups

          work to get all the strings in the init section.
