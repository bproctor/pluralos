                                ------------
                                Things To Do
                                ------------


echo    - Accourding to the X/Open V3 standard, echo does not except any
          options.  There should be a way to allow options to the echo
          command if an environment variable is set or something.  This
          needs some thought.

fold    - Folding lines with this utility is nearly useless, find a way to
          make this utility better with new options, or possibly create a
          new utility that formats the lines better than just sticking a 
          newline at the end.

tee     - Need to add the -a and -i options

cal     - Still not printing proper calenders.  The start day for a month is
          not always correct.  Try January, 2003.

newgrp  - Need to add ability to ask for a password if necessary to change
          the group.

date    - Need to add ability to set the time.
        - Need to fix -u so that the UTC time is corrected for.

seq     - Need to add the -f option so that formats are printed correctly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Possible Additions

replace - Similar to 'tr' or 'expand'/'unexpand' but replaces the file
          instead of outputing to a new one.

Status of utilities
-------------------

- If any of the utilities marked as 'working' does not function correctly,
  please submit a bug report to <bugs@plural-os.org>.  Check that there is
  not already a comment listed here about your bug before submitting however.

- If a utility is marked as 'started' it means that some work has been
  done, but by no means is complete.

- If a utility is marked as part of another package, check that package
  for it's status.

- Utilities that have not been marked, have not yet had any work on them at
  all.

- SCCS will eventually become it's own package.
