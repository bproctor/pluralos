<h2>Name</h2><br>

  chmod - Change file permisions

<h2>Synopsis</h2><br>

  chmod long-option<br>
  chmod mod files ...

<h2>Description</h2><br>

  The <b>chmod</b> utility changes the permission bits described in
  <b>mod</b> of the file <b>file</b>.

  <p>
  <b>mod</b> can be described in two ways, the first is a set of four octal
  digits.  If the first of the octal digits is not specified, it is assumed
  to be 0.  The following three are required.  They are created by adding up
  the desired permissions as descibed below.  The synopsis for this method
  can be described as [O]OOO where O is an octal digit<br>

  <table>
   <tr>
    <td><b>1</b></td>
    <td>Read permission</td>
   </tr>

   <tr>
    <td><b>2</b></td>
    <td>Write permission</td>
   </tr>

   <tr>
    <td><b>4</b></td>
    <td>Execute permission</td>
   </tr>
  </table>

  <br>The set of octal digits is as follows:<br>

  <table>
   <tr>
    <td><b>First digit</b></td>
    <td></td>
   </tr>

   <tr>
    <td><b>Second digit</b></td>
    <td>Describes permissions given to the owner of the file</td>
   </tr>

   <tr>
    <td><b>Third digit</b></td>
    <td>Describes permissions given to the group the owner belongs to</td>
   </tr>

   <tr>
    <td><b>Fourth digit</b></td>
    <td>Describes permissions given to everyone else</td>
   </tr>
  </table>

  <p>
  The second way to descibe the permission bits is using a letter to descibe a set of users,
  followed by +, - or = to add, remove, or set permission, followed by a combination of
  letters descibing what permission to change.  For example, `g=rw' sets permission so the
  group has read and write permissions.  `o-x' removes execute permission from others but any other
  permissions that may exists are not affected.  The first letter can be one
  of the following:

  <table>
   <tr>
    <td><b>u</b></td>
    <td>The user that owns the file</td>
   </tr>

   <tr>
    <td><b>g</b></td>
    <td>The group the owner belongs to</td>
   </tr>

   <tr>
    <td><b>o</b></td>
    <td>Everyone else who is not the owner and not a member of the group the
        owner belongs to</td>
   </tr>
  </table>

  <br>The last part can be made up of one or more of the following letter:<br>

  <table>
   <tr>
    <td><b>r</b></td>
    <td>Read permission</td>
   </tr>

   <tr>
    <td><b>w</b></td>
    <td>Write permission</td>
   </tr>

   <tr>
    <td><b>x</b></td>
    <td>Execute permission</td>
   </tr>
  </table>

<h2>Options</h2><br>

  <table border=0>
   <tr>
    <td><b>--help</b></td>
    <td>Print the help message and exit</td>
   </tr>

   <tr>
    <td><b>--version</b></td>
    <td>Print program version and exit</td>
   </tr>
  </table>
