<h2>Reporting Bugs</h2><br>

If you have found a problem, first check this manual page for the utility in
question to see if the behavior is actually part of the utilities
specification.  If it really is a bug, check the section <a
href="utils-4.html">Bugs</a> to see if the bug is already known.

<p>
Reporting bugs helps the development of the utilities. If you have found a bug
in one of the utilities or in this manual, please send a bug report to
<a href="mailto:bugs@plural-os.org">bugs@plural-os.org</a>.
