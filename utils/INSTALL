1. Building the programs
------------------------

  To build all the programs, type `make'

  To build a particular program, just type `make progname'.

  examples:
          make ls
          make rmdir
          make od


2. Testing the programs
-----------------------

  You can run the tests for the programs by typing `make test',
  or you can test an individual program by typing `make test/progname'.

  examples:
          make test
          make test/basename
          make test/cut

  If you want to see more of what is going on during the testing, you can
  replace test with vtest to get more detailed output.


3. Install the programs
-----------------------

  To install the programs type `make install' this will put all the programs
  in their proper directories, whether it be /bin, /usr/bin, or /sbin; and the
  man files will be put in the /usr/man directory.


3.1 INSTALL_DIR
---------------

  You can change whether the base directory is /usr or /usr/local by
  modifying the INSTALL_DIR variable at the top of the Makefile.  The man
  pages wil go in either /usr or /usr/local depending on this setting.  This
  will only affect programs that are to be installed in the /usr directory,
  no other programs will be relocated by changeing this. 


3.2 ROOT_DIR
------------

  If you are building a test partition mounted elsewhere on your filesystem,
  you can change the base install directory by editing the top Makefile and
  change the variable ROOT_DIR.  For example,  To install the programs in the
  /mnt/test/ directory: ROOT_DIR=/mnt/test/ otherwise, use ROOT_DIR=/ to
  install normally.
